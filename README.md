Project Overview 

Our goal is to develop a cutting-edge security solution that integrates advanced facial recognition technology with NFC capabilities. This smart lock system aims to enhance the safety and convenience of securing access to spaces, providing users with multiple methods to unlock doors effortlessly and securely. 

Key features of our smart lock include: 

Facial Recognition: Seamlessly unlock doors using state-of-the-art facial recognition technology. 

NFC Chip Access: Alternative unlocking method using NFC-enabled devices for added flexibility. 

Team Contributions 

Below is a brief overview of the contributions made by each team member toward the success of this project requested by Aminah Balfaqih: 

 

Ofelia Hănțoiu 

I developed a desktop application that facilitates employee management. The application allows users to add new employees, with their details being automatically added to the database. It also includes functionality for removing employees, ensuring that the database is updated in real-time when an employee is deleted. Additionally, the application provides an overview of all tables present in the database, offering a comprehensive view of the database structure and its contents. These features ensure that the database remains consistently updated and current, providing an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing employee information. 

 

Thu Tran 

I’m responsible for creating UI design for the desktop application and develop a login, sign-up pages for the app. I work on both front-end and back-end of login and sign-up system. For the login and log out function, I ensure that the database connections are established so that data can be retrieved and shown in the app. Except from that, I also implement function to store data such as email and password entered by the user in sessions to compare with the registered credentials stored in ADMIN table in our database. Regardless of the sign-up page, I implement a password hashing function to store the password to the database securely, when user registers for a new account with their email address and password, the password will be hashed and stored. The navigation from login page to main application page and back to login page after users log out is also developed by me.  

Beside from working with the desktop application, I also create a 3D model of the lock case. The case consists of 3 parts, which are container, where camera, screen and NFC reader are stored. The remaining parts are covers, which keep the components inside the container.

I have created one version of the case that holds all the components, giving it a clean and modern look. The main feature of the "Smart Lock" is a Bolt Latch, the only part visible on the outside of the case. I have designed and printed all of the components to which the servomotor is attached and the related code as well. The latch uses a rack and pinion mechanism powered by the MicroServo 9g. When someone gains access to the room using facial recognition or an NFC card, the servomotor moves the pinion, which slides the rack to open the door. After a short pause, the motor then rotates the wheel in the opposite direction in order to re-lock it. 

 

Mihail Josan 

Throughout the entire period 4, I served as the team leader, responsible for maintaining organization and balance within the team, as well as tracking everyone's progress. 

Regarding the project, I worked closely with my colleague Cristian to set up the Raspberry Pi. We installed all the necessary libraries required for our project. Initially, we faced challenges as the setup did not work on the first attempt. This necessitated a reinstallation of the operating system and starting the setup process again, which took a considerable amount of time and effort to get everything correctly configured. 

Following the setup, I hosted a database using the Azure portal, ensuring that access to the database was restricted by IP address, enhancing the security of our server. Additionally, I participated in the documentation process, creating the pinout diagram, data flow diagram (DFD), and other essential parts of the documentation. 

Subsequently, Cristian and I collaborated to develop the Raspberry Pi application. This involved incorporating all the necessary algorithms, connecting the application to the database, linking it to the room, and integrating various other features that our app required. 

Throughout this period, I was committed to ensuring that the project progressed smoothly and that all team members were aligned and on track with their tasks. 

 

 

Cristian Trifan 

Regarding the project, I worked closely with my colleague Mihail to set up the Raspberry Pi. We installed all the necessary libraries required for our project. Initially, we faced challenges as the setup did not work on the first attempt. This necessitated a reinstallation of the operating system and starting the setup process again, which took a considerable amount of time and effort to get everything correctly configured. I also worked on the app for the Raspberry PI implementing what was needed. For the Raspberry Pi we installed CameraPI 2, the screen, the servo and the NFC. For the documentation, I created the work instructions for the Raspberry Pi and for the desktop app. In addition, I made some small changes in the desktop app and installed some important libraries such as dlib (one of the most problematic library). 

 

 

Joris Backis 

I focused on researching, designing, and implementing the facial recognition functionality and database structure. My contributions include: 

Project Research and Design: researched authentication methods, developed initial and final ERD and DFD, and updated the project design document. 

Database Management: Set up experimental and Azure databases, designed and created necessary tables, and connected them to our scripts. 

Facial Recognition Implementation: Developed scripts for adding user data, implemented real-time facial recognition, and worked on performance improvements. 

NFC Technology: Researched NFC, experimented with reading/writing NFC cards, and integrated NFC data into the database. 

Admin Application: Designed and developed the admin app for managing employees, worked on log functionality, and made continuous improvements. 

Documentation and Presentation: Authored the Technical Advisory Report, updated project documents, added ERD, DFD, and flowcharts, and contributed to the final presentation. 

 

Yen Phan 

I was in charge of coding the interface for the project, which includes the main page and every pop up windows of the page. This involved creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for the applications we developed, ensuring that the end-users could easily navigate and interact with the system. Additionally, I assisted with the 3D printing of the lock case, working on both the design and the actual printing process to ensure that all components fit together correctly and functioned as intended. My contributions helped ensure that the project was both functional and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for the end-users.
